# Healthcare Assistant Project

In this project you will build a conversational system that can answer questions about common healthcare issues listed on the NHS Scotland website: [https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/a-to-z/Links to an external site.](https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/a-to-z/)

## Suggested Tasks

1. Design a system. How should it interact? What information does it need and what information should it give? How will you establish user requirements?
2. Use Azure ASR, TTS to build this into a app or webpage to communicate using speech.
3. Using Azure and prompting, integrate an LLM to generate structured dialogue which can address the task.
4. Write a thorough evaluation plan
5. Create a working system and evaluate it using a formal HCI heuristic evaluation process.
6. Produce a 10 minute presentation for Week 7
7. Produce a 3-5min video demonstrating the working system for Week 12

How can you improve the system? What shouldn't it do? What are the ethical implications?

## Requirement

The requirements for the F20CA group project are as follows:

1. It results in a built system that uses TTS, ASR and LLMs accessed through Azure to support a conversational assistant (CA).
2. A formal heuristic evaluation is carried out and included in the report (see [Heuristic Evaluation )Links to an external site.](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/how-to-conduct-a-heuristic-evaluation-for-usability-in-hci-and-information-visualization)
3. A plan for user evaluation
