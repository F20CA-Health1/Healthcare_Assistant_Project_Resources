# Healthcare Assistant Project

In this project you will build a conversational system that can answer questions about common healthcare issues listed on the NHS Scotland website: [https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/a-to-z/Links to an external site.](https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/a-to-z/)

Suggested Tasks:

1. Design a system. How should it interact? What information does it need and what information should it give? How will you establish user requirements?
2. Use Azure ASR, TTS to build this into a app or webpage to communicate using speech.
3. Using Azure and prompting, integrate an LLM to generate structured dialogue which can address the task.
4. Write a thorough evaluation plan
5. Create a working system and evaluate it using a formal HCI heuristic evaluation process.
6. Produce a 10 minute presentation for Week 7
7. Produce a 3-5min video demonstrating the working system for Week 12

How can you improve the system? What shouldn't it do? What are the ethical implications?

The requirements for the F20CA group project are as follows:

1. It results in a built system that uses TTS, ASR and LLMs accessed through Azure to support a conversational assistant (CA).
2. A formal heuristic evaluation is carried out and included in the report (see [Heuristic Evaluation )Links to an external site.](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/how-to-conduct-a-heuristic-evaluation-for-usability-in-hci-and-information-visualization)
3. A plan for user evaluation
